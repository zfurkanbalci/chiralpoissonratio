# chiralpoissonratio
This repository contains the FEA-generated datasets of a chiral auxetic mechanical metamaterial for mesh sensitivity analysis (0.2 mm, 0.25 mm, 0.3 mm). All data were produced by the authors to ensure transparency, reproducibility, and support further research on Poisson’s ratio prediction.
